        <ol>
            <li>Wash and cut 2.2 lbs or 1 kg worth of potatoes into a medium to large dice. No need to peel them, just wash the dirt off well.</li>
            <li>Add the diced potatoes to a large bowl and season with salt and pepper to your liking, drizzle in 1 tbsp of oil and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Spray a large sheet pan with oil and spread the potatoes out over the surface. Roast the potatoes at 400 °F (204 °C) for 25 minutes, tossing halfway through. Cook them until you have achieved your desired level of browning.</li>

        <ol>

            <li>Heat a large skillet over high heat and add in about 2 tsp of oil. Add the peppers and onions first and allow them to cook for 3-5 minutes first to develop color. Season them lightly with salt.</li>
            <li>Create some space in the center of your pan and add an additional 1 tsp of oil and dump in your mushrooms and zucchini. Season lightly with salt and give these a chance to brown.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to overcook these as it will negatively impact their texture.</li>
